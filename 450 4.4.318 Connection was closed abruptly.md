# '450 4.4.318 Connection was closed abruptly (SuspiciousRemoteServerError)'

## Problem

only one of our customers (who relied on Office365) could not send mail to our server, receiving the error:

450 4.4.318 Connection was closed abruptly (SuspiciousRemoteServerError)

there were no logs on the Exchange server of delivered mail but we could send mail correctly to them

## Solution

After digging through the logs of our firewall (watchguard), we are able to understand that the client's server (outlook.com) tried to communicate with ours but could not complete the communication.

Unfortunately there was no clear indication in the logs of the dropped connection, Or we have not been able to find it (the "Dimension" of watchguard is not a very agile tool to use).

After disabling IPS and also APT the problem wasen't solved.
At the end, thanks to a guy in a forum, I understand that the problem was related to the limit of Header size of the mail,  set in the SMTP proxy action of the firewall (Watchguard), setting it to a big dimension solved the problem.

The client was having a header bigger the 20KB.
