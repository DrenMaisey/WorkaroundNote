## MultiRDP with MIMIKATZ

the tool can be downloaded form this [Link](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases)

you must extract and then run the exe inside the folder named "x64"

in the console input:

```command promt
privilege::debug
ts::multirdp
```
one command per time, one command per line

of course the RDP service must alredy be enabled and activated

the MultiRDP will be alive till the console remai open. That's not a definitive upgrade of the multirdp
